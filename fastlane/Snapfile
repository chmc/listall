# List of simulators to use for screenshot generation
# Using iOS 17.5+ (available on macos-14 with Xcode 16.1)
# iPhone 16 Pro Max is 6.7" which is acceptable for App Store 6.5" slot
# NOTE: Device names vary by Xcode version - CI uses Xcode 16.1 which has iPhone 16 Pro Max (not iPhone 17)
devices([
  "iPhone 16 Pro Max",      # 6.7" display (closest to App Store 6.5" requirement)

# Screenshots will be generated for both English and Finnish

# OPTIMIZATION: Try not erasing simulator between languages
# With reinstall_app(true), app state is fresh anyway
# This may save 2-3 minutes per device by reusing booted simulator

# Note: test_without_building and derived_data_path are set in Fastfile
# to coordinate with the scan(build_for_testing) prebuild step

# Concurrent mode causes keychain access conflicts during code signing

# Disable result bundle to allow Fastlane to auto-extract screenshots

# xcbeautify filters NSLog output that Fastlane needs to find screenshots
