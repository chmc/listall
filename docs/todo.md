# ListAll App - Development Tasks

## Phase Organization (Updated for Better Context Management)
**Note**: Large phases have been split into smaller, more manageable chunks (3-5 tasks each) to improve context memory management and ensure consistent adherence to behavioral rules (build validation, testing, etc.).

### Phase Splitting Summary:
- **Phase 6** → Split into 6A, 6B, 6C (List Management)
- **Phase 7** → Split into 7A, 7B, 7C, 7D (Item Management)  
- **Phase 8** → Split into 8A, 8B (Smart Features)
- **Phase 9** → Split into 9A, 9B, 9C (Image Management)
- **Phase 10** → Split into 10A, 10B (Data Export)
- **Phase 11** → Split into 11A, 11B (Data Import)
- **Phase 13** → Split into 13A, 13B (Settings)
- **Phase 14** → Split into 14A, 14B (Advanced Features)
- **Phase 15** → Split into 15A, 15B (Performance)

- ❌ **Implement data validation for CloudKit sync** (optional enhancement)

### CloudKit Capability Details:
- **Current Status**: CloudKit integration code is complete and ready
- **Blocking Issue**: Free Apple ID cannot add iCloud capability to Xcode project
- **Required Action**: Upgrade to paid Apple Developer Program ($99/year)
- **Alternative**: Continue development without CloudKit sync (app works locally only)
- **Impact**: Without CloudKit capability, sync features will show "offline" status
- **Timing**: Complete this before Phase 17 (Polish and Release) when preparing for App Store

## Testing Strategy (Integrated Throughout All Phases)
- ✅ Test infrastructure is set up and working
- ✅ Write unit tests for all services as they are implemented
- ✅ Create integration tests for Core Data + CloudKit when implemented
- ✅ Add UI tests for critical user flows as features are built
- ❌ Implement accessibility testing for UI components
- ❌ Create performance tests for large datasets when needed
- ❌ Add export/import functionality tests when features are implemented
- **CRITICAL**: All new code must be tested - write tests for every new feature, service, or component implemented
- **IMPORTANT**: Tests must verify the written code and its behavior, ensuring it works as intended
- **PRINCIPLE**: Do NOT change implementation to fix tests unless implementation is truly impossible to test
- **REQUIREMENT**: When implementing new features, you must write corresponding tests to verify functionality

### Current Test Status:
- ✅ UI Tests: 100% passing (12/12 tests)
- ✅ UtilsTests: 100% passing (26/26 tests) - Fixed by removing deprecated resetSharedSingletons() calls
- ✅ ServicesTests: 100% passing (1/1 tests) - Fixed by removing deprecated resetSharedSingletons() calls  
- ✅ ModelTests: 100% passing (24/24 tests) - Fixed by adding @Suite(.serialized) for test isolation
- ✅ ViewModelsTests: 100% passing (41/41 tests) - Fixed by adding @Suite(.serialized) + async timing fix
- 🎯 **OVERALL UNIT TESTS: 100% PASSING (96/96 tests)** - COMPLETE SUCCESS!
- ✅ Test Infrastructure: Complete with TestHelpers for isolation (createTestMainViewModel, createTestItemViewModel, etc.)
- ✅ Major Fix Applied: Removed all deprecated resetSharedSingletons() calls and updated to use new isolated test infrastructure
