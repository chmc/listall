All this data is stored in:

If you choose to enable iCloud sync:

## Data Retention and Deletion

### How Long We Keep Data
We don't keep any data because we don't collect any data. All your information stays on your device or in your personal iCloud.

### How to Delete Your Data

**To delete all app data:**

2. Go to General → iPhone Storage
3. Find ListAll

This removes all local data. For iCloud data:
