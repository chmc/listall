# It is recommended to not store the screenshots in the git repo.
# Instead, use fastlane to re-generate the screenshots whenever they are needed.

# We generate screenshots locally and commit the normalized versions
# Raw/intermediate screenshots are ignored, normalized ones are tracked

# Ignore all raw/intermediate screenshot files

# KEEP (track) normalized Watch screenshots (396x484)
# Note: Use git add -f to initially add watch_normalized/

# KEEP (track) processed macOS screenshots (2880x1800 with gradient background)
# Un-ignore mac/ so git descends into it, then ignore its raw contents

# KEEP (track) normalized iPhone/iPad screenshots (1290x2796, 2064x2752)
# Note: screenshots_compat/ is outside screenshots/ so it's tracked by default

# Framed screenshots (for marketing, generated from normalized screenshots)
# These are generated artifacts that can be recreated from normalized versions
